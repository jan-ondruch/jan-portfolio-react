# Personal Portfolio (simplified)

Main goal was to try building a website from scratch using NodeJS, ReactJS and Material Design.<br>
The website itself represents my CV (simplified version).<br>
Every single page contains slightly different components - my goals was to try using different ones and learn how they work.<br><br>

[Check out the demo pictures here.](https://github.com/jan-ondruch/personal-portfolio-react/tree/master/screenshots)

### To run the project locally:
`npm install` (installing all packages and dependencies)<br>
`npm start` (staring the localhost server)

## Project Status:
Finished for technology demonstation purposes.<br>
Website is finished ~80% from having it fully deployable.

### What'd need to be done to make it fully functional:
Refine content - text, images, colors.<br>
Refine responsive design - mobile devices might not have the most optimal UX.<br>
Add missing real links.

## What I learned:
Building a website from scratch using NodeJS (npm, webpack), ReactJS (react-bootstrap, react-router) and Material Design (material-ui).<br>
Basic understanding of the latter technologies and tools.<br>
Better usage of Sublime Text editor.<br>
Possibility of using inline styles when there is not much to style.<br>
Document and manage my own project.<br>
Meet the deadlines I set for myself - realistic deadlines, count with some buffer time.<br>
Plan more in detail before going coding.
