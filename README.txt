Project length: ~14days

Description:
Main goal was to try building a website from scratch using NodeJS, ReactJS and Material Design.
The website itself represents my CV (simplified version).
Every single page contains slightly different components - my goals was to try using different ones and learn how they work.

Installation:
npm install (installing all packages and dependencies)
npm start (staring the localhost server)

Status:
Finished for technology demonstation purposes.
Website is finished ~80% from having it fully deployable.

What'd need to be done to make it fully functional:
Refine content - text, images, colors.
Refine responsive design - mobile devices might not have the most optimal UX.
Add missing real links.

What I learned:
Building a website from scratch using NodeJS (npm, webpack), ReactJS (react-bootstrap, react-router) and Material Design (material-ui).
Basic understanding of the latter technologies and tools.
Better usage of Sublime Text editor.
Possibility of using inline styles when there is not much to style.
Document and manage my own project.
Meet the deadlines I set for myself - realistic deadlines, count with some buffer time.
Plan more in detail before going coding.
